    "The main diffeerence between the \"standard error of the mean\" and the \"standard deviation\" of the original data is that they are statistics about different objects. \n",
    "The standard deviation represents the variability -- how spread individual data points are from the mean -- of the original dataset.\n",
    "The standard error of the mean represents the expected variability of the sample mean. In the other words, the standard error tells us how accurately the sample mean estimates the population mean.\n",
    "Moreover, the standard error of the mean changes with the change of sample size. For example, when we increase the sample size of a bootstrapped sample, the standard error of the mean would decrease. This is because a larger sample size has more stable sample means, and that makes the standard error of the mean, who represents the variability of sample means, smaller.\n",

    "1. **Bootstrapping Explanation**: We discussed bootstrapping as a statistical technique for estimating the distribution of a statistic by resampling data with replacement. This method allows you to estimate sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and standard errors without needing to make strong assumptions about the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Difference Between Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and Standard Deviation (SD)**: I explained that the **standard deviation (SD)** measures the variability of individual data points, while the **standard error of the mean (SEM)** measures the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. The SEM decreases as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effect of Sample Size on Variability of Means Using Bootstrapping**: I provided an explanation of how the variability of the means of simulated (bootstrapped) samples decreases as the sample size increases. Larger samples result in a more precise estimate of the population mean because the means of different samples become more stable and less variable.\n",

    "To create a 95% confidence interval using the standard error of the bootstrap means, first Let's use 1000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset and calculate the mean of each sample. Then, let's find the mean and standard error of these bootstrap means. Finally,  we can use the formula to find the 95% confidence interval: CI = (the mean of the bootstrapped sample means) plus or minus (the Z-score (1.96 for 95% confidence)) times (the standard error of the mean). \n",

    "   - You asked how to use the \"standard error of the mean\" (SEM) to create a 95% confidence interval that covers 95% of the bootstrapped sample means.\n",
    "   - I explained that you calculate the SEM by taking the standard deviation of the bootstrapped sample means and divide it by the square root of the sample size. You then construct the confidence interval using the formula: \\(\\text{CI} = \\bar{X} \\pm (Z \\times \\text{SEM})\\), with \\(Z = 1.96\\) for 95% confidence.\n",

    "   - I explained that 1000 is a commonly used value for balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, but it is not a strict requirement. Using fewer samples may lead to more variability in estimates, while using more samples can improve accuracy but requires more computational resources. Typically, 1000-2000 samples are sufficient, but the number can be adjusted based on precision needs and computational constraints.\n",

    "1. What is the process of bootstrapping?\n",
    "Bootstraping is a way to sample a dataset when you have a dataset that consists small data points but want to use it to estimate the population. The exact process of bootstrapping is to randomly pick data points from the original dataset, and the number of randomly picked data points should be the same as the number of data points in the original dataset, so that this will give you a \"new sample.\" And we repeat this process for manhy time, usually 1000, to have a large amount of samples to interpretate.\n",

    "2. What is the main purpose of bootstrapping?\n",

    "3. If you had a (hypothesized) guess about what the average of a population was, and you had a sample of size n from that population, how could you use bootstrapping to assess whether or not your (hypothesized) guess might be plausible?\n",
    "If you have a hypothesized guess about the population average and a sample, you can use bootstrapping to test your guess. First, set the null hypothesis (H0) as the population average being your guess number, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) as it not being your guess number. Then, you resample from your original sample and calculate the mean(average) of each sample to build a distribution of means and form a confidence interval. If your guess falls within this interval, you do not reject null hypothesis, which means that your guess is plausible."

Since we failed to reject the null hypothesis, we can't conclude the alternative hypothesis because we don't have enough evidence to say that the alternative hypothesis is correct, which means that the drug has no effect on average. When the confidence interval doesn't include zero, it means that zero is not a plausible population mean, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug has a significant effect."
